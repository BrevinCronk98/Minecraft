        <p>The Minecraft alpha was released on the 28th of June, 2010. Since then it has grown exponentially becoming a multi-billion dollar title.
            The total number of people playing minecraft has reached a stagerring 480 million!! It is a sandbox survival game based in infinite worlds that are created in blocks. 
            You can do anything from building a simple little hut, to hosting a server with thousands of players creating some of the most creative things imaginable.
            The only limit in this game is your imagination!

            I have spent countless amounts of hours playing this game. I have built small scale and large scale projects. The sensation you get when you finish building a big house, or a big boat or practically anything that you genuinely are 
            interested in building is incredible. You can watch the progress right in front of you. It is like coding almost. Big projects require precision when building. depending on what you are building the patters you use have to be symmetrical.
            Its almost like coding. With coding you get to see your project come to life line by line. With Minecraft you see your sctructure come to life one block at a time.
